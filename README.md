# What-you-are-looking-for-


StockLog is a trading journal app I built with the help of AI. I wanted a free tool that actually includes the features traders need for free. You can log trades manually or import them from your broker (CSV or TLG). Then review your performance with advanced analytics, calendars, and timelines—all in one place.
